# Advent Of Code 2022 - Index üéÑü§∂üèΩ

## Introduction

‚ùÑÔ∏è **Santa's reindeer** ü¶å typically eat regular reindeer food, but they **need a lot of magical energy to deliver presents on Christmas**. For that, their favorite snack is a **special type of star** fruit ‚≠ê that only grows deep in the jungleüå≥. The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.

**To supply enough magical energy**, the expedition needs to **retrieve a minimum of fifty stars by December 25th** üìÖ. Although the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in case.
