# Advent Of Code 2022 - Index 🎄🤶🏽

## Introduction

❄️ **Santa's reindeer** 🦌 typically eat regular reindeer food, but they **need a lot of magical energy to deliver presents on Christmas**. For that, their favorite snack is a **special type of star** fruit ⭐ that only grows deep in the jungle🌳. The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.

**To supply enough magical energy**, the expedition needs to **retrieve a minimum of fifty stars by December 25th** 📅. Although the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in case.
