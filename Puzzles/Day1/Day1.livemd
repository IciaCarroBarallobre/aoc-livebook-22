## Calorie Counting (Puzzle 1/2)

The **🌴jungle🌴 must be too overgrown** and difficult to navigate in vehicles or air-access; the 🧝**Elves' expedition traditionally goes on foot**🦶.

The Elves begin taking **inventory** of their supplies, one important consideration is food🍕. In particular, **the number of Calories each Elf is carrying** 🔍🎒: your puzzle input.

The Elves take turns **writing down the number of Calories** 📜 contained by the various meals (🥙), snacks (🍘), rations (🍱), etc., **one item per line**. Each Elf **separates** their **own inventory** from **the previous** Elf's inventory (if any) **by a blank line**.

Example:

```
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
```

This **list represents the Calories of the food carried** by **5 Elves**:

* 🧝 The **first** Elf is carrying food with `1000`, `2000`, and `3000` Calories => Total of `6000`.
* 🧝 The **second** Elf is carrying one food item with `4000` Calories => Total of `4000`.
* 🧝 The **third** Elf is carrying food with `5000` and `6000` Calories => Total of `11000`.
* 🧝 The **fourth** Elf is carrying food with `7000`, `8000`, and `9000` Calories => Total of `24000`.
* 🧝 The **fifth** Elf is carrying one food item with `10000` Calories => Total of `10000`.

In case the Elves get hungry 😋 and need extra snacks, they need to know **how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories**. In the example above, this is `24000` (carried by the fourth Elf).

**How many total Calories is carrying the Elf carrying the most Calories?**
